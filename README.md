  # Description
     This project will utilize Express.js to save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. There will be api calls to the client side html page and routed calls to the JSON file (which will store notes from the user). This application will then be deployed to Heroku.

  # Installation 
     1) Load the page from the deployed URL: https://note-taker-dreji95.herokuapp.com/ 2) The uniqid, fs and express modules were used so type "npm install " to load them from the package.json. 3) start the server from the server.js directory by typing npm start on the bash CLI.

  # Usage 
     The note save, show active note and delete options are currently available on the client side of the app as well as through third party api-request software. (Note: currently delete only shows on page refresh)
